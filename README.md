<h1>Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h1>
    <p>My name is Alice and I am a trans woman learning front end development.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Currently, I am still learning and very much a beginner. I will do my best to upload and update the "lab" assignments from the courses on freeCodeCamp that I am going through, and anything else I work on as I grow.</p>
    <br>
Some quick information
    <ul>
      <li>I started because I figured it would be a good skill though I have continued because it's borderline addicting learning how to code</li>
      <li>I use she/her pronouns, <i lang="it">e in l'italiano, "lei". So solo un po' d'italiano perÃ³.</i></li>
      <li>If you'd like to contact me, I now have an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/alice_solway_webdev?igsh=MWZjcjk4M212a3I3ZA%3D%3D&utm_source=qr" target="_blank">Instagram account</a> for my coding journey that you can message me on.</li>
      <li>I'd be more than happy to help with anything I can, and am absolutely open to any (polite) suggestions to make my code better.</li>
    </ul>
